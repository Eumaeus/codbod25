                    remarkable manuscript from the end of the 10th century, undoubtedly produced in
                    either Constantinople or Smyrna, CB 25 presents all four Gospels together in
                    Greek. The biblical text is accompanied by commentaries by Peter of Laodiceia
                    (an exegetical chain) written in cursive. The volume is decorated with two
                    valuable full-page miniatures representing Luke and Mark against gold
                    backgrounds. (mes)</p>
